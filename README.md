# Abusing CLOS in a Roguelike

The point of this project is to learn Common Lisp, in particular the Common Lisp object system (CLOS) by abusing, bending, and over-using it while building a roguelike.

This is very unplanned and unstructured.  At some point I will copy my progress to another directory and modify from there.

I'm trying to minimize dependencies, so no sdl and no tcod.  Just raw text.
